git add selects changes

git commit records changes LOCALLY

git push shares changes


---
git add adds your modified files to the queue to be committed later. Files are not committed
git commit commits the files that have been added and creates a new revision with a log... If you do not add any files, git will not commit anything. You can combine both actions with git commit -a

git push pushes your changes to the remote repository.

This figure from this git cheat sheet gives a good idea of the work flow

git add --all
git status
git commit -m "committing"
git push -u origin master
